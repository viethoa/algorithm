/**
 * Medium
 * You are given an array of distinct integers arr[],
 * write a program to find all pairs of elements such that their absolute difference is minimum.
 * Return a list of pairs in ascending order (with respect to pairs), each pair [i, j] follows:
 * - i, j are from arr[]
 * - i < j
 * - j - i equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr[].
 *
 * Example 1
 * Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 4]
 * Output: [[2, 3],[3, 4],[4, 5]]
 * Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
 *
 * Example 2
 * Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 13, 17]
 * Output: [[2, 4]]
 * Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 2 between the first two elements.
 *
 * Example 3
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 7, -12, 22, -8, -16, 18]
 * Output: [[-12, -8],[-12, -16],[22, 18]]
 * Explanation: All these pairs have the same minimum absolute difference.Ï
